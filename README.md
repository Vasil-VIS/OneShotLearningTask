# Triplet CNN  for One-Shot Learning

## Task:
Given a query image $x_q$ and a support set of images $x_i$, i âˆˆ [0..4], find which images in the support set correspond to the character given in the query image. The train data is organized in sets of query and support set images. The characters that the model is trained on are different from the characters in the testing dataset. The model needs to learn to recognize and match images that it has not seen before.
